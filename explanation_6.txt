Problem 6

For the union of the linked lists, I used a set to hold the values while I iterated through each linked list. A set works well since it only maintains unique values. Since I'm iterating through each linked list, the run time would be O(n1+n2) where n1 and n2 are the number of items in each linked list. 

For the intersection I used two sets. One set holds the values of the first linked list for lookup purposes since looking up values in a set is O(1). The second set is populated with numbers from the second linked list that is also in the first set. Since I'm iterating through each linked list, the run time would also be O(n1+n2)
